	<h1> About Me </h1>
<p> My name is Matt, and I didn't have to go very far to attend college.  I'm from 
a small town in Massachusetts, born and raised.  One of my biggest passions
while growing up was sports, and that certainly has not changed.  All through
my childhood, sundays were synonymous with watching football with my dad, summer
evenings were synonymous with the Red Sox, and I would spend Saturday mornings
watching Sportscenter instead of cartoons.  I played sports all throughout 
high school, with football, basketball, and lacrosse being my favorites.  To
this day, I very much consider watching, playing, and talking about sports my
biggest hobby.  </p>
<p> Coming into college, I really wasn't sure what I wanted to study. However,
I started to realize that I really enjoyed learning about the way people's 
minds work, and after taking a computer science course my freshman year,
it was clear to me that cognitive and brain sciences was the path I wanted
to take. I am particularly interested in the computer science aspect, and
in an ideal world I would end up working in a field that could combine my
personal and academic passions, of programming and sports.  I also am quite 
interested in sustainability, and am fascinated by the growing greentech 
industry.  </p>
