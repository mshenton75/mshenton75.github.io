On the whole, I believe the vat majority of this project was correctly implemented. All my html and css files pass validation tests, and they all work as expected.  I have more than 5 rules on both css files, and each html page is implemented as specified.  Additionally, my public_html page automatically redirects to my index page, as specified.

I discussed parts of this project, mainly figuring out permissions, with Meredith Clarke.

I spent approximately 5 hours on this assignment.
